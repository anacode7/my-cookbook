Title: Cheeseboard Cheesecake
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 1 hr cook

Ingredients:
- ? oz Chive
- 1? oz Parmesan
- 26? oz Cream Cheese
- 4 Eggs
- 10? fl oz Double Cream
- 1 tsp Fine Salt
- 3 oz Gorgonzola
- 1? oz Cornflour
- Cream Cracker
- Black Pepper

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 250�C. Line a 20cm cake tin with two sheets of crumpled baking paper, making sure there�s an overhang of 3cm all the way round.
2. Finely chop the chives and finely grate the Parmesan, then set aside. Put the cream cheese into a large bowl and beat until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating in each one entirely. Add the cream, parmesan, chives, fine salt and pepper, then mix to combine. Crumble in the gorgonzola and sieve in the cornflour. Fold in and mix well to combine.
3. Pour the mixture into the lined cake tin and transfer to the oven. Bake for 17-20 mins until dark on the top but very, very wobbly in the middle. It will sink and firm up as it cools! Cover and leave overnight before slicing and serving with crackers, warm bread and chutney.

Notes:
* Oven temperature is for a fan-assisted oven. * Gorgonzola can be replaced with harder, less fatty cheeses to avoid splitting during cooking (Camembert might be too gooey). * The cheesecake tastes amazing and is very moorish. * Let it cool overnight covered before serving.

6. Roll the diced halloumi in oil, then add to the hot side of the BBQ. Grill the halloumi for 3-4 mins, turning now and then, until golden brown and crisp.
7. Pile the salad onto a platter and top with the halloumi. Roughly chop the almonds and scatter over the top. Serve!

Title: Roasted Broccoli with Caesar-ish Sauce and Smoky Seedy Drizzle
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified

2. Place the broccoli onto a lined baking tray and drizzle with plenty of olive oil and rub in some salt and pepper. Cook for 20 mins on the middle shelf.
3. To make the caesar-ish sauce, finely chop ? of the capers until they are almost minced.

Servings: 6
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: - 45 mins cook

Ingredients:
- No ingredients listed

Steps:
1. Slice the onions. Cut the halloumi and cauliflower into bite-sized chunks. Grate the garlic and ginger.
2. Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil. Tip in the onions and cook for 8�10 mins until soft, golden and catching on the bottom.
3. Add the halloumi and fry for 5 mins.
4. Stir in the grated garlic and ginger, followed by the turmeric, chilli powder and garam masala. Cook for a minute until fragrant, then add the cauliflower and tomato pur�e.
5. Pour in the chopped tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir everything together and bring to the boil. Reduce to medium heat and simmer for 20�25 mins until the curry has thickened and the cauliflower is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Leave to cool before storing. The curry will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer. To reheat, whack a portion in the microwave or defrost straight in the pan.

Notes:
- Charlotte W.: Delicious! Used extra hot chilli powder to give it a kick. - Nirupama N.: What can you sub for the halloumi? - Kai K.: Paneer or maybe tofu? - Phil S.: The halloumi definitely needs dry frying off beforehand and adding back at the end, it just gets lost otherwise and doesn�t colour up. Also needed to add lime juice as it�s quite flat. - Elaine T.: Made this with lime coriander rice. Leftover curry tasted even better as flavors developed. Absolutely delicious and filling. - EmmA.: Says vegetable stock on shopping list but not on recipe, obvious mistake. - Paul D.: Tasty. Cook halloumi separately to help browning then add to pot. Used cardamom and cumin instead of garam masala - delish. - Thomas M.: Air fried the halloumi to ease browning on all sides. - Krishna S.: Ingredients reference vegetable stock but can�t see it used in steps? - Sin�Ad K.: Think it should say vegetable oil! - Sarah H.: Is this a batch cook base? Which recipes can be made from it? Looks wonderful! - Mob (Admin): Remixes for this batch are available on the app. ## Additional info: - Serves: 6 Let me know if you want me to extract any other specific part or format differently!

Title: Recipe: Golden Herby Broth with Eggs & Rice
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 25 mins cook

Ingredients:
- Eggs: 6
- Fresh Coriander: 1 oz
- Fresh Parsley: 1 oz
- Fresh Dill: Handful
- Garlic Cloves: 4
- Ground Turmeric: ? tsp
- Dried Mint: 1 tbsp
- Crispy Fried Onions: 1? oz
- Vegetable Stock: 24? fl oz
- Cooked Rice: 14 oz
- Cooked Puy Lentils: 8? oz
- Kefir: 3? fl oz
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified, use as needed)

Steps:
1. Fill a saucepan full of water and place over a high heat. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium, gently drop the eggs in and simmer for 7 mins. Transfer to an ice bath to cool down. Rinse out the pan.
2. Meanwhile, finely mince the coriander, parsley and dill (stalks and all) and thinly slice the garlic.
3. Place the rinsed pan onto medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Once hot, add the turmeric, garlic, fresh chopped herbs, dried mint and ? of the crispy onions. Cook, stirring, until the herbs have softened. Pour in the vegetable stock and let it heat up.
4. In the meantime, reheat the cooked rice and lentils then stir together.
5. Before serving, bring the broth off the heat and leave to slightly cool for a minute. Stir the kefir through the broth then taste and season with salt and pepper.
6. Share the rice and lentils between bowls and ladle the broth over. Top each with 3 jammy egg halves and the remaining crispy onions.

Notes:
- Skipping kefir is possible, still excellent. - Works well with frozen herbs too. - Adding a little more salt and chili flakes recommended by some. - Adding kefir at not too hot temperature to preserve bacteria (below 43�C). - Broth can be frozen without kefir; kefir freezing affects texture. - Avoid reheating rice more than once. - Variations include using different herbs (e.g., tarragon), swapping rice for kale, parsley for chives, adding baked duck legs. - Consider adjusting rice/broth ratio for preference.

Title: Peanut Butter Paneer Curry
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 35 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 1? Red Onions
- ? oz Fresh Ginger
- 4 Cloves Garlic
- 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
- 2 tsp Chilli Powder
- 2 tsp Garam Masala
- 4 tbsp Tomato Pur�e
- 4 tbsp Smooth Peanut Butter
- 14 fl oz Water
- 8 oz Paneer
- 5? oz Frozen Peas
- 4? oz Spinach
- Basmati Rice (quantity not specified)
- 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
- ? Red Onion
- 4 tbsp Natural Yoghurt
- ? oz Fresh Coriander

Steps:
1. Chop the red onions. Scrape into a large saucepan, with a good drizzle of neutral oil and a pinch of salt. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally for 6-8 mins until softened.
2. Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the ginger and garlic. Add to the pan, turn the heat to medium high and cook out for 2-3 mins then add cumin seeds, all the chilli powder, garam masala and tomato pur�e. Cook, stirring for a few minutes more.
3. Add the peanut butter along with water. Using a hand blender blitz until a smooth and creamy curry sauce, season to taste � if you like your curry a little thinner - add a splash more water.
4. Get started on your topping by toasting cumin seeds in a small frying pan until they�re smelling amazing � tip �em into a small bowl.
5. Very finely chop the remaining red onion, add to the bowl with the toasted cumin seeds and some seasoning, stir together.
6. Cut the paneer into bite-sized cubes. Heat the curry sauce until simmering then add the paneer, peas and spinach. Cook until the spinach is wilted and paneer soft, around 2-3 mins.
7. Swirl the yoghurt through the curry, top with the cumin, red onion, and some coriander if you like. Serve with cooked basmati rice.

I added quite a bit extra water - probably around 1 cup. In future I might marinate the cubed paneer beforehand or let it cook a bit longer in the gravy to let it absorb more flavour. - Amica H. (update): made it again but this time I marinated the paneer in yoghurt, cumin powder and some salt. I also cooked it for 2 minutes before adding in the peas and spinach for 3 minutes. I do feel the paneer pieces had more flavour this time! Was delicious. - Louise N.: So delicious!!

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 180�C.
2. Top and tail the celeriac, then use a large knife to trim off all of the skin, without taking off too much flesh. Cut two 2cm-thick steaks from the middle of the celeriac.

3. Pour a drizzle of olive oil over the celeriac steaks and season really well with salt and pepper.
4. Heat an ovenproof frying pan, big enough to fit both steaks, set over a medium-high heat.
5. Lay the celeriac steaks into the pan and cook for 3 mins on one side, until caramelised. Flip and cook for 2 mins, then turn the heat down to medium, add the butter and smashed garlic cloves and baste the celeriac steak for another minute, then flip and baste the other side for a further minute. Put the pan into the oven and roast for 15 mins, until the celeriac steaks are charred and soft.
6. Finely chop the parsley and scrape into a bowl. Roughly chop the capers and add to the bowl along with the mustard, red wine vinegar and a splash of olive oil. Season with salt and cracked black pepper.

The coriander and chilli oil is a brilliant suggestion. - Ross T. (4 months ago): Surprised how well this worked! Tastes just like cream of mushroom soup.

5. Pour in the chopped tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir everything together and bring to the boil. Reduce to medium heat and simmer for 20�25 mins until the curry has thickened and the cauliflower is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Leave to cool before storing. The curry will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer. To reheat, whack a portion in the microwave or defrost straight in the pan.

Notes:
* Lieven F.: "If you cook a large batch, it�ll take quite a bit longer than forty-five minutes. The taste, though, is absolutely delicious!" * Immie L.: "Absolutely delicious. Freezes well too, I will definitely be making another batch once the freezer stock is all gone!" * Charlotte W.: "Delicious! Used extra hot chilli powder to give it a kick." * Nirupama N.: "what can you sub for the halloumi?" * Kai K.: "paneer or maybe tofu?" * Phil S.: "the haloumi definitely needs dry frying off before hand and adding back at the end. it just gets lost otherwise and doesn�t colour up. also needed to add lime juice as it�s quite flat" * Elaine T.: "Made this with the lime coriander rice. Had the leftover curry the next day for lunch and it tasted even better as the flavours had developed. Absolutely delicious and filling. Will definitely make again" * EmmA.: "says vegetable stock on shopping list but not on the recipe so obvious mistake" * Petra P.: "I followed the recipe, for me it was okay to cook the halloumi as it was described. It was delicious, we will do it again." * Paul D.: "Really tasty and like Thomas said, I would probably cook the halloumi separately to help with the browning process and then add it to the pot. I didn�t have any Garma Masala so I used Cardamom and Cumin instead and it was delish" * Thomas M.: "Air fried the halloumi to ease the browning on all sides" If you want, I can also provide a plain text version or formatted as JSON for easier use in applications.

Cooked: Not specified
Time: - 45 mins cook

Ingredients:
- No ingredients listed

Steps:
1. Finely chop the onion. Scrape into a large saucepan. Add 1 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt, then cook over a medium heat, stirring regularly for 8-10 mins until soft but not coloured.
2. Meanwhile, peel the carrots and parsnips and slice into roughly 2cm chunks. Finely chop the garlic cloves, then add to the softened onions, along with the vegetables. Cook, stirring for 1 min, then strip in the thyme leaves. Pour in the stock.
3. Bring the mixture to the boil, then simmer away for 25 mins, or until the carrot and parsnip are completely soft.
4. While the soup simmers, toast the pumpkin seeds in a small, dry frying pan over a high heat for a couple of minutes until they begin to pop. Season with sea salt and set aside.
5. Once the veg is completely soft, turn off the heat, pour in the cream, then blitz using a hand blender until completely smooth. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg, if using. Add a little more water here if you like a thinner consistency. The soup can be made in advance, covered and reheated later if you like.
6. Reheat the soup if needed, then divide between bowls. Drizzle with a little more cream, then top with the toasted pumpkin seeds and a pinch of cayenne or smoked paprika, to serve.

Notes:
- This carrot and parsnip soup is a testament to how simple ingredients can create a wonderfully comforting meal. - Perfect for batch cooking. - Ideal for freezing individual portions; simply reheat straight from frozen in a pan for a quick and easy meal. - Alternatively, store the soup in the fridge, where it will keep well for up to a week. - Combines the natural sweetness of carrots with the earthy flavor of parsnips. - Seasoned with your favorite spices and herbs; customizable to your taste (e.g., cumin or fresh coriander). - For creamy texture, consider adding Greek yogurt or a splash of vegetable stock. - Enjoy with crusty bread for a complete comfort food experience. ## User Feedback Highlights - Chloe C.: Delicious; pumpkin seeds are best part; made bread to go with it. - Sarah W.: One of the best soups made at home; added dried rosemary instead of thyme. - Catriona F.: Delicious; omitted pumpkin seeds and thyme, added bay leaves; kids loved it; great with cheddar cheese grated in.

Suggests blitzing nuts and chocolate so they�re not too chunky. Mix all dry ingredients first. Made smaller servings. Added a dash of sea salt. * Jessica R.: Used an egg instead of flaxseed and water with fabulous results. * Chloe R. (Admin): Egg substitution not tested, but theoretically okay; suggested 1 small egg. * Joanne B.: Cookies keep well for a few days. Reduced sugar and replaced half ground almonds with ground oat flakes, resulting in delicious cookies. * Richard H.: Questions calling this a healthy cookie due to refined sugar content. * Joanne B.: Believes protein and fiber offset the sugar. * Emma S.: Calls it definitely a healthy cookie; used plain flour instead of ground almond and baked for 15 mins instead of 10.

Use rice vinegar and sesame oil instead of water if it�s dry rather than water for a bit more flavour" - Alex G.: "super tasty! confused by the second entry red onion in the recipe so did 2 in the end.

Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 50 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 10? oz (300 g) 70% Dark Chocolate
- 7 oz (200 g) Unsalted Butter
- 6 Eggs
- 3? oz (100 g) Dark Brown Sugar
- ? tsp Vanilla Extract
- Pinch Sea Salt
- 1 tsp Baking Powder
- 5 tbsp Cocoa Powder
- 1 tsp Espresso Powder
- Handful Cacao Nib

Steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 180�C fan. Grease and line a 20cm round cake tin. Break the dark chocolate into rough pieces and cut the butter into rough cubes.
2. Set a heatproof mixing bowl above a slightly smaller saucepan of boiling water over a medium heat (for a bain marie). Add the chocolate, espresso powder (if using) and butter to the bowl and stir until melted. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to room temp.
3. Meanwhile, separate the egg whites and yolks into two separate bowls. Add the sugar to the egg yolks and whisk (using an electric whisk if possible) for 5 mins until yellow and creamy, then stir through the vanilla and salt.
4. In a clean dry bowl, use an electric whisk to beat the egg whites and baking powder together, starting on a low speed and increasing the speed gently until stiff peaks are formed. If working by hand, you may have to whisk for a while longer.
5. Stir the melted chocolate mixture into the yolk mixture, then sift in the cocoa powder. Stir in a small spoonful of the beaten whites and whisk thoroughly, then very carefully fold in the remaining whites in two parts, until just incorporated. Be careful not to overwork it or you'll knock the air out of the mixture.
6. Transfer the mixture to your prepared tin, level out to the edges and sprinkle the cacao nibs (if using) on top of the batter. Bake for approximately 25 mins � the middle should wobble slightly when the tin is shaken gently.
7. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins before turning out on to a wire rack to cool completely or serving hot. Dust with the espresso powder before serving, if you like.

Notes:

Title: Cauliflower 65
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 30 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 1 Cauliflower
- 10 Curry Leaves
- Vegetable Oil
- 2 Green Chillies
- 5 Curry Leaves
- 2 tbsp Vegetable Oil
- ? tsp Ground Turmeric
- 1 tsp Kashmiri Chilli Powder
- ? tbsp Ginger Paste
- ? tbsp Garlic Paste
- 2 tbsp Yoghurt

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 180�C. Thinly slice the green chillies for the marinade and transfer to a bowl. Add the remaining marinade ingredients, season with salt and mix well.
2. Trim the cauliflower, then rub the marinade all over. Place onto an oiled baking tray, transfer to the oven and roast for 30-35 mins until tender. Crank the oven temperature up to 200�C and roast for another 5 mins to get some colour onto the cauliflower.
3. Meanwhile, add a glug of oil to a small frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Once hot, drop the curry leaves in and fry until darkened (they�ll splutter, so be careful). Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.
4. Once the cauliflower is cooked, plate up and drizzle over the pan juices. Finish with a scattering of crispy curry leaves.

Notes:
- Use a whole cauliflower for a show-stopping presentation. - Roasting in the oven instead of deep-frying results in a healthier dish. - Frying curry leaves adds a crispy texture and flavor; be careful as they will splutter. - The final high-temperature roast adds color and slight crispness to the cauliflower.

My partner isn�t a huge fan of coriander, so he suggested a little less as an improvement, but I loved it as was!" - Becc S.: "Absolutely delish! I added some chopped tenderstem broccoli (steamed for a couple of mins), and subbed the brown onion some leftover red onion that had been pickling for a few days in lemon juice. I would say don't use all the ponzu dressing, the salad was swimming in it (I'd use half next time)!" - Marie C.: "Really tasty! Subbed in red onion and just added quinoa to bulk it out and was very delicious."

Title: Recipe: Creamy Courgette Gratin
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: - 35 minutes cook time

Ingredients:
- 2? lb Courgettes
- 1 oz Basil
- 5? oz Cr�me Fra�che
- 2? fl oz Milk
- 1 tsp Flour
- ? tsp Ground Nutmeg
- 1? oz Parmesan
- 1? oz Cheddar Cheese
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- ? Pinch Chilli Flakes
- 2 x 400g Cans Chopped Tomatoes
- 5 tbsp Olive Oil

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 200�C. Slice the courgettes into ?cm-thick rounds. Add 3/5 of the olive oil to a large saucepan and place over a medium heat.
2. Add the courgettes, half the basil and a big pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, for 7 to 10 mins until the courgettes have softened and released some of their liquid. Drain well in a colander and give them a gentle press to remove all the excess liquid.
3. Transfer to an ovenproof dish which is small enough to give the courgettes some height.
4. Mix the cr�me fra�che, milk, flour and nutmeg together with a pinch of salt. Spread the courgettes into an even layer, then pour the cr�me fra�che mixture on top and grate over the cheeses. Bake for 25 mins until golden and bubbling.
5. Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic. Rinse out the saucepan you cooked the courgettes in and place over a medium heat. Add the rest of the olive oil and the chopped garlic.
6. Once the garlic is sizzling, add the remaining basil and chilli (if using). After 30 seconds, pour in the tomatoes. Add 2 tsp salt and bring to a simmer. Cook for 25 mins at a gentle simmer until thickened.
7. Leave the courgettes to rest for 10 mins after cooking and serve a generous slice on top of a few spoons of tomato sauce. Finish with a little extra cheese.

Notes:
- Frances M.: "Really tasty - thumbs up from me" - Tom S.: "really good! This is more of a side dish tbh� made a few changes/swaps for what was in the fridge - feta instead of Parmesan, used mandalin instead of half cm thick cuts, Greek yogurt for the cr�me fresh - all worked great, look and consistency looked a bit weird of white sauce but didn�t affect the taste (probably should have drained the courgettes better to prevent) added veggie meatballs to the tomato sauce to make a more substantial dinner." - Ann R.: "I love this! So quick to prepare and the b�chamel style cheese sauce is so simple! Delicious!" - Abigail A.: "A hearty and well rounded dish." - Anna K.: "So yummy!" - Rachel L.: "Delicious side dish" If you want me to prepare it in any other format or add anything else, please let me know!

I used a chipotle paste that was spicy enough without adding chilli flakes. Crumbles a bit of feta on top at the end. Only note: mushrooms didn't need so long in my oven."

Ingredients:
- 4 Courgettes
- 1 oz Fresh Mint
- 3 Garlic Cloves
- 2 tbsp Tahini
- 1? Lemons
- 1 tsp Ground Cumin
- Chilli Flakes (to serve)
- 2 tsp Sumac (to serve)
- Pitta Bread (to serve)
- 3 tbsp Olive Oil

Steps:
1. Set the grill to high or use a very hot BBQ. Grill or BBQ the courgettes whole until blackened on all sides. This will take at least 15-20 mins if using a grill (less on a BBQ).
2. Meanwhile, roughly chop the fresh herbs and set aside. Crush the garlic to a paste and set aside.
3. Carefully remove the courgettes from the heat source and place on a chopping board to cool slightly. Slit the courgettes open lengthways to speed this up. When cool enough to handle, finely chop the courgettes (including the burnt skin) and scoop into a mixing bowl. Drain some of the liquid as it appears in the bowl if you like, or set the chopped courgettes over a sieve in a bowl for 10 mins. Alternatively, leave the liquid in for a looser texture.
4. Add the crushed garlic to the courgette bowl along with the tahini, cumin, lemon juice and zest and olive oil. Mix thoroughly, beating until creamy. Season with salt.
5. Spread the courgette mix out on a serving plate and dress with chilli flakes, sumac, a drizzle of olive oil, and the chopped herbs. Serve with flatbread, pitta or toasted bread on the side.

- 3? oz Edamame
- 3? oz Peas

- ? Lemon
- 4? fl oz Olive Oil
- 1 tsp Dijon Mustard
- 1? oz Anchovies

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 190�C. Use scissors to snip the pittas into 3cm triangles, then put them on a large baking tray. Add the broccoli and fennel seeds, drizzle with olive oil and season well. Toss and make sure everything is well coated. Slide into the oven for 10-15 mins, or until the broccoli is charred and the pitta chips are crisp.
2. Meanwhile, make your dressing. Add the yolk to a bowl and lightly whisk. Add a small squeeze of lemon juice, then very slowly add the oil, a trickle at a time, whisking as you go until it�s emulsified into a thick mayo. Add the Dijon.
3. Add the parsley, mint, basil and anchovies to a blender with the rest of the lemon juice and a splash of water, then blitz into a paste. Tip the paste into the dressing and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
4. Cut the base from the lettuce and pull the leaves apart. Put into a large bowl. Slice the cucumber in half lengthways and use a spoon to scrape out the fleshy middle, then slice into half moons and add to the bowl along with the peas and edamame. Halve, de-stone and peel the avocado, slice into cubes and add to the bowl. Add the herb leaves.
5. Cut the halloumi into small chunks. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the halloumi and cook for 5 mins, turning the chunks as they colour. Remove from the heat and add the honey.

Ingredients:
- 1 Celeriac
- 3? fl oz Double Cream
- 1 Garlic Clove
- ? oz Fresh Thyme
- 6 Black Peppercorns
- 1? oz Salted Butter
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified)

Steps:
1. Top and tail the celeriac, then use a large knife to trim off all of the skin, without taking off too much flesh. Dice into 2cm cubes and tip into a saucepan.
2. Pour in enough cold water to completely submerge the celeriac and season generously with salt.
3. Set over a high heat and bring to the boil. Once simmering, turn the heat down to medium-high and cook for 15 mins, until the celeriac is very soft.
4. Meanwhile, pour the double cream into a small saucepan. Put the garlic clove, still in its skin, onto the chopping board and use the flat side of a large knife to bash it against the chopping board. Add this to the cream along with the thyme sprigs and black peppercorns.
5. Set the small saucepan over a medium heat and bring up to a simmer. Once simmering, remove from the heat and leave to infuse.
6. Drain the celeriac really well through a fine sieve, then tip into a bowl or back into the dry pan.
7. Use a potato masher to crush and mash until roughly smooth, or you can use a stick blender to whizz until smooth - or if you want it really smooth, tip into a blender and whizz to a super smooth pur�e.
8. Put the fine sieve over the bowl and pour in the double cream, catching all the infusion bits.
9. Add cubes of the butter and keep mashing and mixing until combined and smooth.
10. Season really well with salt and pepper and serve.

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 180�C.
2. Top and tail the celeriac, then use a large knife to trim off all of the skin, without taking off too much flesh. Cut two 2cm-thick steaks from the middle of the celeriac. Save the rest for soup or mash (can tag both). Use the flat side of the knife to bash the garlic cloves on the chopping board to flatten them.
3. Pour a drizzle of olive oil over the celeriac steaks and season really well with salt and pepper.
4. Heat an ovenproof frying pan, big enough to fit both steaks, set over a medium-high heat.
5. Lay the celeriac steaks into the pan and cook for 3 mins on one side, until caramelised. Flip and cook for 2 mins, then turn the heat down to medium, add the butter and smashed garlic cloves and baste the celeriac steak for another minute, then flip and baste the other side for a further minute. Put the pan into the oven and roast for 15 mins, until the celeriac steaks are charred and soft.
6. Finely chop the parsley and scrape into a bowl. Roughly chop the capers and add to the bowl along with the mustard, red wine vinegar and a splash of olive oil. Season with salt and cracked black pepper.
7. Remove the celeriac steaks from the oven and divide between plates, spooning on some of the butter. Serve with a good drizzle of salsa verde.
8. Preheat the oven to 170�C.
9. Start by prepping your vegetables. Peel your celeriac, cut it in half, and chop it into thin slices. Halve your leeks, discarding the woody ends, and slice them into thin half-moons. Grate your garlic and pick your thyme leaves off their tough stalks.
10. Melt your butter in a large saucepan. Add your leeks and cook over a low-medium heat for 15 minutes until they are totally soft and sweet. Pop your garlic and thyme into the pan and cook out for 1 minute.
11. Pour your cream and milk into the pan and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add your celeriac and simmer for 15 minutes until your cream has thickened and your celeriac is just tender. Add your nutmeg.
12. Whilst your mixture simmers, grate your Gruy�re. Combine with your panko breadcrumbs in a bowl and set aside.
13. Pour your celeriac and leek mixture into a baking dish and top with your cheese and breadcrumbs. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.
14. Remove your foil, then bake for another 20 minutes until golden and bubbly.

Title: Fish & Celeriac Stew
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 30 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 14 oz Frozen Cod
- 1 Celeriac
- 1 Red Onion
- 1 tsp Fennel Seed
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 4 Anchovies
- 6? fl oz White Wine
- 28? oz Passata
- 8? oz Drained Cooked Chickpeas
- 1 Bunch Parsley
- Salt (quantity not specified)
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified)

Steps:
1. Take your cod out of the freezer and de-frost it.
2. Preheat your oven to 180�C / 356�F.
3. Finely slice your onions and whack them on a baking tray with a pinch of salt, pepper, and a drizzle of oil. Place the tray in the oven and roast for 20 minutes.
4. Dice your celeriac, then heat a glug of oil in a pan and fry it over a low heat.
5. Slice your garlic and anchovies, and add them to the celeriac along with your fennel seeds and chilli flakes. Fry until golden brown.
6. Pour in your glass of wine and passata, stir together then bubble down for 5 minutes.
7. Toss through your chickpeas then keep bubbling for 10 further minutes until the sauce is nice and thick.
8. Chop the cod into chunks and stir it into the dish. Leave to simmer for 5 minutes for the cod to cook through.
9. Once the fish is nice and flakey, finely chop up your parsley and scatter into the dish with your roasted onions (saving some of each for garnish). Season and give it a good stir.
10. Serve up into 4 bowls and garnish with parsley, some roasted onion and a drizzle of oil. Enjoy!

Notes:
- Charring the celeriac makes it all nutty and caramelised. With the flaky cod, in the rich tomatoey stew, it's a dream. ### User Notes: - Polly K. (4 months ago): Flavours are really good! Would recommend cutting the celeriac quite small and cooking the sauce for longer. I also added some sugar. - Robyn M. (1 year ago): It's delicious but with peeling and chopping the celeriac and onion and getting everything browned, defrosted, reduced etc., it took over 2 hours rather than 30 minutes! I also added a sugar cube because I thought the sauce needed it.

Ingredients:
- 3? oz Goat Cheese
- 3? oz Hazelnuts
- 1? oz Salted Butter
- 2 Courgettes
- ? oz Mint
- 2 tbsp Hot Honey
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified)

Steps:

4. Meanwhile, pick the mint leaves and set aside.

Notes:
- Jo C.: "With this with years courgette glut this recipe has been on regularly rotation. Discovered goats cheese pearls which I have served on this both frozen & fresh although they look like mini marshmallows they are a great fun addition." - Becky M.: "Forgot to put the goats cheese in the freezer lol but was still gorgeous. I personally wish I�d cut the courgette into smaller chunks or even long slices as I feel they taste better that way. Just a tip to make sure the courgette has cooled before serving - my meal went quite watery bc I couldn�t wait lol. Would make again for sure, thanks Jodie!" - Amy H.: "Love this recipe, to the point I tend to leave a block of goats cheese in the freezer now! If I want to bulk it out a bit, I either chuck it all on top of some extra salad leaves or occasionally add a chicken breast. I also tend to use plain honey and add chilli flakes so I can get the heat levels to my preference." - Julie B.: "We served this as a starter and it was just delicious." - Mary D.: "And then I tried it with Parmesan just because that�s what I had." - Mary D.: "This was easy to make and tasted great."

- 1 tsp Dijon Mustard
- ? Lemon
- Olive Oil (quantities specified in steps)

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 220�C. Slice the aubergines in half lengthways, then slice each half into 3 long wedges and put them all on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt. Wrap the garlic bulb in foil and snuggle onto the same tray. Roast for 45 mins, until the aubergine is charred and collapsing.
2. Meanwhile, blitz the sourdough to the size of chunky breadcrumbs. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium high heat, add the breadcrumbs and fry, stirring, for 6-8 mins, until golden. Finely grate the parmesan over the breadcrumbs for the last minute and toss well, coating and letting the parmesan melt. Tip into a bowl.
3. Meanwhile, whisk 3 tbsp olive oil with the oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the charred aubergine wedges to the oil and toss.
4. To make the dressing, grate the plum tomatoes, discarding the skin. Add the grated tomato to a blender along with 3 tbsp olive oil, the mustard and lemon juice, plus seasoning. Squeeze the roasted garlic flesh from the bulb and into the blender, then blitz until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Drain and slice the mozzarella and slice the beef tomatoes. Season both with salt. Place the aubergine and sliced tomatoes onto a big platter, then snuggle the mozzarella around it. Season with salt, then drizzle over the tomato dressing. Scatter the parmesan breadcrumbs on top and finish with basil, an extra drizzle of olive oil and a crack of black pepper.

Title: Leek, Tenderstem & Feta Frittata
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: - 45 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 3 Leeks
- 8? oz Tenderstem Broccoli
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 11 Eggs
- 5? oz Feta
- 8? oz Kale
- 1 oz Parsley
- 1 Lemon
- 1? oz Yoghurt
- 1 Flatbread
- Olive Oil (quantity used: 1 tbsp for croutons, 3 tbsp for frying veggies, 3 tbsp for kale salad)

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 180�C. Tear the leftover flatbreads into large chunks and add them into a tray with 1 tbsp olive oil. Season with salt and bake for 10-15 mins until crispy. If you didn't save any flatbread, use any bread you have!
2. Finely slice the broccoli stalks, then roughly chop the florets. Trim and thinly slice the leeks.
3. Add 3 tbsp of olive oil into a medium sized oven-safe frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the leeks and broccoli to the pan, season with salt and fry until softened, 4-5 mins, then add the garlic and cook for a further 1 min.
4. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a bowl, and season generously with salt and pepper. Finely chop most of the parsley (stalks and all), saving a few leaves for the salad, then add the chopped herbs to the eggs and whisk until incorporated.
5. Remove the pan from the heat, space the veggies out into one layer and pour the eggs over, making sure to get into every nook. Crumble the feta over and bake for 20 mins, or until a knife comes out clean.
6. While the frittata cooks, zest the lemon and squeeze the juice of the zested lemon into a bowl, add the kale, then drizzle 3 tbsp of olive oil, season with salt, pepper. Using your hands massage/squeeze for 3-4 mins, until the kale leaves wilt and are not as tough. Set aside.
7. Toss your croutons into the salad and drizzle with yoghurt. Top with the reserved parsley leaves and some extra feta, if you like. Slice up the frittata and serve on plates or in meal-prep boxes with a side of salad.

Notes:
- Sarah H.: "Really tasty and great meal prep for a healthy lunch or breakfast." - Jenny L.: "Love this frittata, the veg to egg ratio is perfect, delicious as it is but also very easy to sub in any leftover veg you have lying around. I skip the salad and have this for breakfast." - George D.: "11 eggs Jeremy? That's insane." - Mob (Admin): "Hi George! It does sound like a lot but you need all that egg to coat the veg :)" - Lucy B.: "Do you really mean 11 eggs??"

Test pan heat by dropping water droplets - they should bead and dance, not evaporate immediately. - **Mob Admin Clarification:** For stainless steel pans, after mixing courgettes with eggs, preheat the pan again on medium heat before pouring the mixture in. ## Serves: 4 people

Lasts well in the fridge so can do for a few lunches, it's super tasty and nice and healthy!"

Title: Recipe: High-Protein Cauliflower Soup With Sticky Onions
Category: Not specified
Servings: 4
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: - 1 hour cook

Ingredients:
- No ingredients listed

Steps:
1. Chop two onions and all of the garlic. Peel and cut the potato into 2cm cubes. Roughly chop the cauliflower into small pieces, including the stem.
2. Add the 3-4 tbsp oil to a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent and softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic, stir, and cook for another minute or so, until fragrant but not browned.
3. Make the stock by dissolving the stock cubes in the boiling water.
4. Add the curry powder, ground turmeric, garam masala, and coriander. Stir, allowing the spices to toast for about 30 seconds.
5. Add in sweet potato, cauliflower, vegetable stock, and silken tofu. Cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 25-35 mins.
6. Using an immersion blender, or a standing blender, blend the soup until it is smooth and creamy. Add a little more water if you want a thinner texture.
7. To make the tarka topping, start by finely slicing the remaining onion. Melt 3 tbsp coconut oil in a frying pan on medium low. Add the mustard seeds and sizzle for a minute or two, before adding the red onion and a pinch of salt. Fry the onion for 10-15 minutes on a medium-low heat until softened and slightly sticky, stirring often.
8. Then, add the curry leaves, turmeric and chilli flakes, along with a pinch of salt. Sizzle over a low-medium heat for a final 2-3 minutes. Drizzle on top of the soup to serve.

Notes:
- This soup packs in some secret protein by swapping out coconut milk for silken tofu. It gives it a delicious creamy texture without an overpowering taste. - The spicy, crispy onion topping really makes it. - Some users noted the protein content is around 7g per portion and questioned the "high-protein" label. - There was an issue with soup being watery; water amount adjusted from 1.7L to 1L after feedback. - Adding a little cayenne or sausage on the side was suggested by users for extra flavor. - The recipe serves 4.

Title: Greek Style Tomato & Feta Fritters
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 25 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 1 Cucumber
- 3 Tomatoes
- ? Onion
- ? oz Parsley
- ? oz Mint
- 1 Courgette
- 4? oz Self Raising Flour
- 7 oz Feta
- 5? fl oz Vegetable Oil
- 10? oz Greek Yoghurt
- ? Lemon
- 1 Clove Garlic
- 1 Egg

Steps:
1. Halve the cucumber lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Grate the cucumber straight into a sieve and mix with a large pinch of salt. Allow to drain while you make the fritters.
2. Finely chop the tomato, onion and herbs. Reserve half of the mint and add everything else to a large bowl along with the egg. Grate in the courgette and add 100g of flour, the feta and a large pinch of salt, mix well.
3. Depending on the moisture in the tomatoes you might need to add the remaining flour to ensure the mix binds together. The batter should be thick and paste-like, add more flour, if needed, to get it to the right consistency.
4. Heat ? an inch of vegetable oil in a nonstick frying pan. When the oil is hot, add the mix in heaped tablespoons, keeping each heaped heap a couple of inches apart.
5. Fry for about 3 mins on each side until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon onto kitchen paper.
6. Squeeze as much remaining liquid as possible from the cucumber and then combine in a bowl with the yoghurt, juice of half a lemon, the remaining mint and a pinch of salt.
7. Grate in the garlic, mix well and spread over a small plate. Stack a few fritters next to the yoghurt and serve.

Notes:
- Theo D.: Used slightly less tomato for less watery mixture (added extra flour). Took around 45 minutes instead of 25. Found fritters a little oily but balanced with pickled salad. - Rachel D.: Initially mixture was too wet so added more flour and an extra egg. Enjoyed them despite not liking vegetables much. Plans to try pepper and spinach next time. - Jess W.: Recommended as a great way to use courgettes and tomatoes from the garden. - Georgia R.: Mixture was very wet, added more flour after first attempt. Kept half mix overnight, added more flour and an extra egg for better result. - Mob (Admin): Updated method for clarity based on feedback. ## Chef Jordon Ezra King - chef and storyteller sharing knowledge on cooking techniques and dish provenance. **End of recipe details**

Title: Recipe: Watermelon and Feta Salad with Crispy Shallots
Category: Not specified
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 35 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 2 Banana Shallots
- 3 Limes
- 3 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar
- 1 Watermelon
- 1 Red Onion
- 21? oz Tomatoes
- 7 oz Feta
- ? oz Basil
- ? oz Mint
- Vegetable Oil (quantity for frying shallots: cover shallots in 100ml vegetable oil)
- 8 Eggs
- 3 Onions
- 4 Potatoes
- 3 Roasted Red Peppers
- 1? oz Anchovies
- 1 tbsp Smoked Paprika
- 4 tbsp Aioli
- 2 Spring Onions
- Olive Oil (approx 100ml + plenty for cooking)

Steps:
1. Thinly slice the shallots, place in a small saucepan and cover with 100ml vegetable oil.
2. Heat the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a slow simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots are deeply golden. Don�t be tempted to increase heat to speed up the process - getting evenly crisp shallots takes a few minutes.
3. Strain the oil into a heatproof bowl and let the shallots cool in the sieve. They will crisp up as they cool.
4. Juice the limes and add them to the strained shallot oil, along with the red wine vinegar and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Leave to cool while you prep the veg.
5. Peel and cut the watermelon into large chunks. Thinly slice the red onion. Halve the cherry tomatoes. Cut the feta into large chunks. Roughly chop the fresh basil and mint.
6. Place everything in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper.
7. Add the dressing and toss to coat.
8. Plate the salad up on a platter. Top with the crispy shallots then serve and enjoy!
9. Heat your oven to 220�C.
10. Wash and thinly slice the leek and courgette. Cut the pepper into medium-sized chunks and the asparagus into small chunks.
11. Transfer the leek, courgette and green bell pepper to a large roasting tin, drizzle with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, arrange in a single layer and roast for 15 mins.
12. Take the veg out of the oven and add the asparagus. Toss to coat, then pop back into the oven for 10 mins.
13. Meanwhile, boil and drain the peas according to the package instructions.
14. Place the garlic in a mortar and pound to a paste with a pestle. Add the basil and olive oil and pound until well combined. Alternatively, you can do this in a food processor.
15. Transfer the roasted veg to a large bowl. Add the peas, a big squeeze of lemon juice and the basil mixture and toss everything together. Taste, adjust the seasoning and leave to cool.
16. Cut the bread into slices, chuck it into the same tray and drizzle with olive oil. Bake in the oven for 10 to 15 mins, or until crisp. Meanwhile, deseed and chop the chilli. Leave the bread to cool for 5 min then blitz in a food processor with the chilli, salt and pepper.
17. To serve, plate up the veg on the bottom of a large plate or platter. Top with the burrata and chilli crumb then tuck in and enjoy!
18. Preheat the grill to medium-high (190�C).
19. Crack your eggs into a large bowl, season with salt and whisk with a fork. Set aside.
20. Thinly slice your onions and get them into a pan with plenty of olive oil. Cook down with a pinch of salt for 9-10 mins until caramelised.
21. Meanwhile, peel and slice your potatoes as thin as you can. Chuck them into the pan with the onions and add a shed load of olive oil, approx 100ml (trust me).
22. Cover and cook, stirring regularly for 7-8 mins until the potatoes are just tender. Now drain off the excess oil (save this for later!) and mix the onions and potatoes into the eggs.
23. Slice up the peppers and roughly chop the anchovies and get them into the bowl with the eggs. Mix everything together and season with salt, pepper and a generous pinch of sweet smoked paprika.
24. Now grab a 24cm non-stick frying pan (trust me, you want it non-stick). Add a splash of the leftover olive oil and preheat over medium-low.
25. Dump the egg mixture into the pan (you should hear a gentle sizzle) and shake to distribute the potatoes, peppers and anchovies throughout the pan.
26. Now turn down the heat and cook for 10-12 mins until the sides begin to set. Pop it under the grill for 4-5 minutes.
27. Now, grab a large plate or lid and flip the tortilla out. Slide it back into the pan and cook for another 3-4 mins. Turn the tortilla out onto a chopping board and cut into wedges.
28. Now top with aioli, extra paprika and sliced spring onions. Serve with a green salad if you fancy it.
29. In a dry pan, toast the sesame seeds on a low heat for 5 mins until fragrant. Leave to one side.
30. Grate courgette and place in a large sieve over the sink/a bowl.
31. Grate Apetina paneer, ginger and garlic in a bowl.
32. Finely dice one chilli, 2 spring onions and add to the paneer mixture, along with the toasted sesame seeds and chilli flakes. Mix until combined.
33. Press out as much water as you can from the courgette, then add it to the paneer mixture.
34. Finally add in the flour and mix together.
35. In a separate bowl, beat 2 eggs with salt, pepper, gochujang and soy sauce until well combined. Add this to the paneer mixture.
36. Heat up roughly 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a frying pan on medium heat, then add 4 large tablespoons of the paneer mixture and flatten them out to form four even-sized fritters. Fry for 3 mins on each side.
37. Then, add some more coconut oil to the pan, and fry two eggs.
38. Arrange fritters on a plate and squeeze over some lime juice. Top them with your fried eggs and garnish with sesame seeds, spring onions and more chilli flakes if desired.
39. Preheat the oven to 180�C.
40. Char the leeks directly on the flame of your gas hob until they are evenly blistered. If you don�t have a gas hob, char them under a very hot grill.
