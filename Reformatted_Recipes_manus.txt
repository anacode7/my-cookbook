Title: Cheeseboard Cheesecake
Category: Dessert
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 1 hr cook

Ingredients:
- ? oz Chive
- 1? oz Parmesan
- 26? oz Cream Cheese
- 4 Eggs
- 10? fl oz Double Cream
- 1 tsp Fine Salt
- 3 oz Gorgonzola
- 1? oz Cornflour
- To serve:
- Cream Cracker
- Black Pepper

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 250¡C. Line a 20cm cake tin with two sheets of crumpled baking paper, making sure thereÕs an overhang of 3cm all the way round.
2. Finely chop the chives and finely grate the Parmesan, then set aside. Put the cream cheese into a large bowl and beat until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating in each one entirely. Add the cream, parmesan, chives, fine salt and pepper, then mix to combine. Crumble in the gorgonzola and sieve in the cornflour. Fold in and mix well to combine.
3. Pour the mixture into the lined cake tin and transfer to the oven. Bake for 17-20 mins until dark on the top but very, very wobbly in the middle. It will sink and firm up as it cools! Cover and leave overnight before slicing and serving with crackers, warm bread and chutney.

Notes:
from users & chef comments Oven temperature is for a fan-assisted oven. Gorgonzola can be replaced with harder, less fatty cheeses to avoid splitting during cooking (Camembert might be too gooey). The cheesecake tastes amazing and is very moorish. Let it cool overnight covered before serving. If you want, I can also provide this in a formatted text file or any other format you prefer.

- 5? oz Fresh Peas
- 1 Lemon
- 1 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar
- 1 tbsp Dried Oregano

Steps:
1. Pile coals over to one side of your BBQ to create a hot, direct cooking side, and a warm, indirect cooking side.
2. Pop your bulgur wheat into a bowl and rinse well with cold water. Bring a pot of salted water to the boil and pour in the rinsed bulgur. Cook for 10 mins, then drain. Pop back into the pan and cover with a lid, then allow to steam for 10 mins.
3. Cut the halloumi into chunky cubes and split the broccoli into quarters through the stem. Oil and salt the broccoli and get it straight onto the hot side of your grill. Cook, undisturbed, for 4-5 mins or until the cut-side of the broccoli is super charred. Flip over and give the broccoli another 4-5 mins.
4. While the broccoli grills, finely chop the chilli, cucumber, red onion and parsley. Tip into a bowl with the warm bulgur, then add the fresh peas, the juice of the lemon and the vinegar. Add the oregano and parsley.
5. Once grilled, pull the broccoli off the grill and roughly chop. Toss through the bulgur. Add plenty of olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Toss everything together and set aside.
6. Roll the diced halloumi in oil, then add to the hot side of the BBQ. Grill the halloumi for 3-4 mins, turning now and then, until golden brown and crisp.
7. Pile the salad onto a platter and top with the halloumi. Roughly chop the almonds and scatter over the top. Serve!

Notes:
from users This has crept in as a new weekly regular! subbed apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar and still ???? (19 days ago) Delicious! And very easy to make. I didnÕt have halloumi so I subbed goat cheese and WOW! Absolutely delicious, perfect healthy, hearty lunch. Love this salad, at any time of year, made it today on a grey and rainy day and it certainly made me feel sunny inside! ?? Very refreshing in the summer. Who doesnÕt love halloumi?

Title: Roasted Broccoli with Caesar-ish Sauce and Smoky Seedy Drizzle
Category: Roast
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 

Ingredients:
- For the Broccoli
- 2 Heads Broccoli
- For the Smoky Seeds
- 3 tbsp Mixed Seeds
- 1? tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil
- 1? tbsp Olive Oil
- 1 tsp Chilli Flakes
- 1 tsp Smoked Paprika
- For the Vegan Caesar Sauce
- 1? tbsp Capers
- 10? oz Unsweetened Soya Yoghurt
- 2 tbsp Nutritional Yeast
- 2 tbsp Miso Paste
- 1 tsp Dijon Mustard
- 2 tbsp Caper Brine
- ? tsp Garlic Powder
- ? Lemon (juice)

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 200¡C fan. Cut the broccoli in half from lengthways, then cut each piece in half again so you have 4 big wedges. Repeat with the second broccoli head.
2. Place the broccoli onto a lined baking tray and drizzle with plenty of olive oil and rub in some salt and pepper. Cook for 20 mins on the middle shelf.
3. To make the caesar-ish sauce, finely chop ? of the capers until they are almost minced. Add them to a bowl along with the rest of the sauce ingredients, including the juice of the lemon, and whisk until combined. Season well with plenty of salt and pepper. Adjust the flavour by adding more capers for texture, lemon juice for acidity, or dijon or miso for depth.
4. Toast the seeds in a small frying pan on medium heat for a couple of minutes until starting to brown. Add the sesame oil and olive oil and cook for another minute or two. Then add the chilli flakes, smoked paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
5. To serve, spoon most of the sauce onto the bottom of a large plate and arrange the broccoli on top. Drizzle over the remaining sauce and the seedy drizzle and a few of the remaining capers, if you like.

Notes:
This vegan caesar-ish sauce is a super flavourful, quick and easy way to pack flavour onto roasted broccoli. You donÕt need a blender for it. Adjust flavours as needed with capers, lemon juice, dijon mustard, or miso paste. Emma F. commented: "Such an easy weeknight dinner!" If you need anything else, just ask!

Title: Ratatouille
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 1 hr cook

Ingredients:
- 2 Aubergines
- 3 Peppers
- 2 Courgettes
- 2 Red Onions
- 4 Cloves Garlic
- 1? tsp Dried Thyme
- 2 x 400g Cans Chopped Tomatoes
- 7 oz Cherry Tomatoes
- 2 tsp Red Wine Vinegar
- 1? tsp Sugar
- ? Lemon
- ? oz Fresh Basil
- 4 tbsp Olive Oil
- Salt
- Black Pepper

Steps:
1. *Step 1.** Cut the aubergine into 2cm pieces, then do the same for the courgette and the peppers. Finely chop the garlic, then peel and finely slice the red onion.
2. *Step 2.** Add a quarter of the olive oil to a large heavy-bottomed saucepan set over a medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the aubergines, courgettes and peppers. Cook each batch for about 5 mins, stirring occasionally, until golden all over. Transfer to a bowl as you go. The veg wonÕt be fully cooked yet - this step is all about building flavour.
3. *Step 3.** Add the rest of the oil to the same pan. DonÕt worry if the bottomÕs caught a bit, thatÕll lift when the liquid goes in. Tip in the red onions with a big pinch of salt and cook for 10 mins until soft and jammy. Stir in the garlic and dried thyme and cook for another 2 mins.
4. *Step 4.** Pour in the chopped tomatoes, then add the browned veg back in along with the cherry tomatoes, red wine vinegar and sugar. Season well with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, pop on a lid and let it bubble gently for 30 mins. Take the lid off and cook for another 5 mins to thicken everything up.
5. *Step 5.** Tear in the basil and squeeze over the juice from half a lemon. Give it all a stir and serve.

Notes:
(3) Anna M. (15 days ago): Loved it, the basil and the squeeze of lemon at the end make all the difference. Victoria G. (3 months ago): As a French who has high expectations of ratatouille, this one turned out really disappointing. Not enough chopped tomatoes, and it tasted quite bland. Unknown (4 months ago): should it be plum or chopped tomatoes as the ingredients and method reference different types.

Steps:
1. :
2. Slice the onions. Cut the halloumi and cauliflower into bite-sized chunks. Grate the garlic and ginger.
3. Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil. Tip in the onions and cook for 8Ð10 mins until soft, golden and catching on the bottom.
4. Add the halloumi and fry for 5 mins.
5. Stir in the grated garlic and ginger, followed by the turmeric, chilli powder and garam masala. Cook for a minute until fragrant, then add the cauliflower and tomato pure.
6. Pour in the chopped tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir everything together and bring to the boil. Reduce to medium heat and simmer for 20Ð25 mins until the curry has thickened and the cauliflower is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
7. Leave to cool before storing. The curry will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer. To reheat, whack a portion in the microwave or defrost straight in the pan. > Eating some now? Simply serve with rice.

Notes:
from users (selected): Charlotte W.: Delicious! Used extra hot chilli powder to give it a kick. Nirupama N.: What can you sub for the halloumi? Kai K.: Paneer or maybe tofu? Phil S.: The halloumi definitely needs dry frying off beforehand and adding back at the end, it just gets lost otherwise and doesnÕt colour up. Also needed to add lime juice as itÕs quite flat. Elaine T.: Made this with lime coriander rice. Leftover curry tasted even better as flavors developed. Absolutely delicious and filling. EmmA.: Says vegetable stock on shopping list but not on recipe, obvious mistake. Paul D.: Tasty. Cook halloumi separately to help browning then add to pot. Used cardamom and cumin instead of garam masala - delish. Thomas M.: Air fried the halloumi to ease browning on all sides. Krishna S.: Ingredients reference vegetable stock but canÕt see it used in steps? SinAd K.: Think it should say vegetable oil! Sarah H.: Is this a batch cook base? Which recipes can be made from it? Looks wonderful! Mob (Admin): Remixes for this batch are available on the app.

Ingredients:

Steps:

Notes:
: Blanch the cauliflower briefly before roasting for a softer texture. Do not skip the chivesÑthe fresh flavor balances the cheesy sauce perfectly. Adding leeks, broccoli, or sweetcorn works well for variation. Can adjust roasting time if you prefer cauliflower with more bite. Great comfort food; definitely a firm favourite.

Title: Ultimate Cauliflower Cheese
Category: General
Servings: 4
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: but wow

Ingredients:
- 1 Cauliflower
- 2? oz Salted Butter
- 2? oz Plain Flour
- 14 fl oz Whole Milk
- 14 fl oz Double Cream
- 3? oz Mature Cheddar Cheese
- 3? oz Gruyre
- 2 tsp English Mustard
- ? Nutmeg
- ? oz Fresh Chive

Steps:
1. *Step 1:** Heat the oven to 220¡C fan. Cut the cauliflower into large florets, then cut the stem into 2cm pieces. Tip onto a baking tray along with any nice, young leaves from the cauliflower. Drizzle with a little oil, season well with salt and pepper and put into the oven for 25 mins until beginning to char at the edges.
2. *Step 2:** Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium-high heat. Once foaming, tip in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 4-5 mins until the colour has noticeably darkened and it is smelling toasty. Lower the heat to medium. Measure the milk and cream into a large jug, then pour in a little bit of it and whisk furiously. Keep repeating this process until you have a luscious, smooth sauce.
3. *Step 3:** Coarsely grate the cheddar and gruyre and scatter ? of it into the sauce, spoon in the mustard and finely grate in the nutmeg. Stir together over a medium heat until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper.
4. *Step 4:** Once the cauliflower has roasted, tip it into a high-sided baking dish where the florets sit relatively snugly in an even layer. Pour the sauce over the top, then scatter with the remaining cheese. At this stage, you could cover and chill for up to 24 hours before finishing.
5. *Step 5:** Turn or heat the oven to 200¡C fan. Pop the cauli cheese in the oven (we like to put it on a flat baking sheet to catch any drips) and bake for 20-25 mins or until golden and bubbling.
6. *Step 6:** Finely chop the chives and scatter over for a final allium punch.

Notes:
from users Hannah M.: "absolutely banging - found that it got a little oily near the end, always happy to hear tips for reducing that but honestly worth every bit of effort, stunning!" Ben C.: "very generous portion sizing - IÕd make a little less of it next time but wow, so so good" Paul R.: "Can this be frozen to be finished at a later date?" SheilA.: "Substituted the cream for some water as the sauce was really thick also added a dash of black garlic paste to the sauce. very tasty easy recipe." Janaina A.: "nice. I added some sun-dried tomatoes, too." Justyna W.: "I expected it to be a mediocre dish at most, but it turned out to be absolutely delicious instead ;) blanch the cauliflower briefly first, and do not skip the chives, it balances the cheesy sauce perfectly. Great comfort food." Malak H.: "this is delicious. i would blanch the cauliflower before roasting next time so that itÕs a bit softer - depends on if you like cauliflower with a bit of a bite or softer." Mandy C.: "definitely a firm favourite, added some leeks." Sarah M.: "Lovely! I added some broccoli and sweetcorn and it was delicious :-)" Jane M.: "Perfect!"

Title: Golden Herby Broth with Eggs & Rice
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 25 mins cook

Ingredients:
- (metric / imperial)
- Eggs: 6
- Fresh Coriander: 1 oz
- Fresh Parsley: 1 oz
- Fresh Dill: Handful
- Garlic Cloves: 4
- Ground Turmeric: ? tsp
- Dried Mint: 1 tbsp
- Crispy Fried Onions: 1? oz
- Vegetable Stock: 24? fl oz
- Cooked Rice: 14 oz
- Cooked Puy Lentils: 8? oz
- Kefir: 3? fl oz
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified, use as needed)

Steps:
1. Fill a saucepan full of water and place over a high heat. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium, gently drop the eggs in and simmer for 7 mins. Transfer to an ice bath to cool down. Rinse out the pan.
2. Meanwhile, finely mince the coriander, parsley and dill (stalks and all) and thinly slice the garlic.
3. Place the rinsed pan onto medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Once hot, add the turmeric, garlic, fresh chopped herbs, dried mint and ? of the crispy onions. Cook, stirring, until the herbs have softened. Pour in the vegetable stock and let it heat up.
4. In the meantime, reheat the cooked rice and lentils then stir together.
5. Before serving, bring the broth off the heat and leave to slightly cool for a minute. Stir the kefir through the broth then taste and season with salt and pepper.
6. Share the rice and lentils between bowls and ladle the broth over. Top each with 3 jammy egg halves and the remaining crispy onions.

Notes:
from Users & Chef Tips Skipping kefir is possible, still excellent. Works well with frozen herbs too. Adding a little more salt and chili flakes recommended by some. Adding kefir at not too hot temperature to preserve bacteria (below 43¡C). Broth can be frozen without kefir; kefir freezing affects texture. Avoid reheating rice more than once. Variations include using different herbs (e.g., tarragon), swapping rice for kale, parsley for chives, adding baked duck legs. Consider adjusting rice/broth ratio for preference.

Lauren C.: Is there a plant based alternative that would work instead of Paneer? Amica H.: I am a huge curry fan and this was sooooo good. I added quite a bit extra water - probably around 1 cup. In future I might marinate the cubed paneer beforehand or let it cook a bit longer in the gravy to let it absorb more flavour. Amica H.

Cooked: Yes
Time: 25 mins cook

- 1 oz Fresh Flat Leaf Parsley (approximately 28g)
- 2 tbsp Capers
- 2 tsp Dijon Mustard

- Extra Virgin Olive Oil (quantity: drizzle and splash as needed)
- Salt and Pepper (to season)

Steps:
1. :
2. Heat the oven to 180¡C.
3. Top and tail the celeriac, then use a large knife to trim off all of the skin, without taking off too much flesh. Cut two 2cm-thick steaks from the middle of the celeriac.

5. Heat an ovenproof frying pan, big enough to fit both steaks, set over a medium-high heat.
6. Lay the celeriac steaks into the pan and cook for 3 mins on one side, until caramelised. Flip and cook for 2 mins, then turn the heat down to medium, add the butter and smashed garlic cloves and baste the celeriac steak for another minute, then flip and baste the other side for a further minute. Put the pan into the oven and roast for 15 mins, until the celeriac steaks are charred and soft.
7. Finely chop the parsley and scrape into a bowl. Roughly chop the capers and add to the bowl along with the mustard, red wine vinegar and a splash of olive oil. Season with salt and cracked black pepper.
8. Remove the celeriac steaks from the oven and divide between plates, spooning on some of the butter. Serve with a good drizzle of salsa verde.

Notes:
: These celeriac steaks are butter-basted and finished in the oven so theyÕre crisp and caramelised on the outside and meltingly soft within. Finished with a bright, vibrant and punchy salsa verde. You wonÕt believe how delicious this roasted celeriac recipe is. For air fryer cooking: Cook and baste in the pan first, then transfer to the air fryer to finish cooking with butter etc. Doing it all in an air fryer may not give an even golden/deep colour.

- 10? oz Silken Tofu
- 10? fl oz Vegetable Stock
- Sesame Oil (quantity: "a good drizzle")

- 1 oz Fresh Coriander
- 4 Slices Crusty Bread (toasted sourdough)

2. Add the mushrooms and soy sauce, then saut until the mushrooms have lost most of their water and are starting to sizzle and turn brown. Turn off the heat.
3. Put half of the cooked mushrooms into a blender, along with the miso paste, tofu and stock. Blend until creamy and smooth.
4. Return the blended soup to the pan, mix with the remaining mushrooms, and warm through.
5. Serve with a drizzle of chilli oil, a small handful of coriander and crusty toasted sourdough.

Notes:
from Users Naomi H. (6 months ago): So creamy and absolutely delicious. So quick too, will definitely be making again. Emma R. (9 days ago): I couldn't find silken tofu in the supermarket, so I used ordinary tofu. The result was something that looked like curdled cement and tasted like it. Foul ?? Angela H. (a month ago): Shared a video of the recipe preparation. Amrit G. (a month ago): Needed more miso and garlic! Overall a nice high protein meal. Carlos B. (a month ago): Not high protein at all. Please remove from the high protein tag. Jessica B. (22 days ago): Tofu is pure protein. Faye H. (3 months ago): This was so quick to make and really delivers on flavour - will definitely be making it again! Marika A. (3 months ago): Really good mushrooms! Added a little more miso and 300g tofu. Stephanie C. (3 months ago): Super easy and quick to make which is a pro, just felt like something was lacking and the texture a bit unusual.. I added garlic and extra dark soy, and it was nice, just not five stars. Metinee K. (3 months ago): Amazing tofu tip/replacement for cream!! So easy, great texture and delicious taste. The coriander and chilli oil is a brilliant suggestion. Ross T. (4 months ago): Surprised how well this worked! Tastes just like cream of mushroom soup. The miso makes it quite salty (which I love) but could easily be reduced. Secretly upping protein intake without much thought - win for veggies!

Immie L.: "Absolutely delicious. Freezes well too, I will definitely be making another batch once the freezer stock is all gone!" Charlotte W.: "Delicious! Used extra hot chilli powder to give it a kick." Nirupama N.: "what can you sub for the halloumi?" Kai K.: "paneer or maybe tofu?" Phil S.: "the haloumi definitely needs dry frying off before hand and adding back at the end. it just gets lost otherwise and doesnÕt colour up. also needed to add lime juice as itÕs quite flat" Elaine T.: "Made this with the lime coriander rice. Had the leftover curry the next day for lunch and it tasted even better as the flavours had developed. Absolutely delicious and filling. Will definitely make again" EmmA.: "says vegetable stock on shopping list but not on the recipe so obvious mistake" Petra P.: "I followed the recipe, for me it was okay to cook the halloumi as it was described. It was delicious, we will do it again." Paul D.: "Really tasty and like Thomas said, I would probably cook the halloumi separately to help with the browning process and then add it to the pot. I didnÕt have any Garma Masala so I used Cardamom and Cumin instead and it was delish" Thomas M.: "Air fried the halloumi to ease the browning on all sides" If you want, I can also provide a plain text version or formatted as JSON for easier use in applications.

Jessica R.: Used an egg instead of flaxseed and water with fabulous results. Chloe R. (Admin): Egg substitution not tested, but theoretically okay; suggested 1 small egg. Joanne B.: Cookies keep well for a few days. Reduced sugar and replaced half ground almonds with ground oat flakes, resulting in delicious cookies. Richard H.: Questions calling this a healthy cookie due to refined sugar content. Joanne B.: Believes protein and fiber offset the sugar. Emma S.: Calls it definitely a healthy cookie; used plain flour instead of ground almond and baked for 15 mins instead of 10. If you want me to format or organize anything else, just ask!

Title: Flourless Chocolate Dinner Party Cake
Category: Dessert
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: N/A

Ingredients:
- 10? oz (300 g) 70% Dark Chocolate
- 7 oz (200 g) Unsalted Butter
- 6 Eggs
- 3? oz (100 g) Dark Brown Sugar
- ? tsp Vanilla Extract
- Pinch Sea Salt
- 1 tsp Baking Powder
- 5 tbsp Cocoa Powder
- *Optional:**
- 1 tsp Espresso Powder
- Handful Cacao Nib

Steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 180ûC fan. Grease and line a 20cm round cake tin. Break the dark chocolate into rough pieces and cut the butter into rough cubes.
2. Set a heatproof mixing bowl above a slightly smaller saucepan of boiling water over a medium heat (for a bain marie). Add the chocolate, espresso powder (if using) and butter to the bowl and stir until melted. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to room temp.
3. Meanwhile, separate the egg whites and yolks into two separate bowls. Add the sugar to the egg yolks and whisk (using an electric whisk if possible) for 5 mins until yellow and creamy, then stir through the vanilla and salt.
4. In a clean dry bowl, use an electric whisk to beat the egg whites and baking powder together, starting on a low speed and increasing the speed gently until stiff peaks are formed. If working by hand, you may have to whisk for a while longer.
5. Stir the melted chocolate mixture into the yolk mixture, then sift in the cocoa powder. Stir in a small spoonful of the beaten whites and whisk thoroughly, then very carefully fold in the remaining whites in two parts, until just incorporated. Be careful not to overwork it or you'll knock the air out of the mixture.
6. Transfer the mixture to your prepared tin, level out to the edges and sprinkle the cacao nibs (if using) on top of the batter. Bake for approximately 25 mins Ð the middle should wobble slightly when the tin is shaken gently.
7. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins before turning out on to a wire rack to cool completely or serving hot. Dust with the espresso powder before serving, if you like.

Notes:
From Molly T., 7 months ago: "I made this recipe and WOW it was so good - my family aren't that into sweet things and they were BLOWN AWAY and polished it off. We enjoyed with vanilla ice-cream and some toasted almonds on the side."

Title: Celeriac Soup with Crispy Sage & Hazelnuts
Category: Soup
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 1 hr cook

Ingredients:
- 1 Celeriac
- 1 Onion
- 3 Garlic Cloves
- 3? oz Butter
- 30 fl oz Chicken Stock
- 3 Bay Leaves
- 5? fl oz Double Cream
- 2? oz Blanched Hazelnuts
- 1 tbsp Vegetable Oil
- 1 Handful Fresh Sage
- Black Pepper (to taste)
- Method /

Steps:
1. Top and tail the celeriac, then use a large knife to trim off all of the skin, without taking off too much flesh. Dice into 2cm cubes. Halve and finely chop the onion, then finely chop the garlic.
2. Melt half of the butter in a large lidded saucepan set over a medium heat and scrape in the diced celeriac and onion. Add a big pinch of salt and put on the lid. Cook for 10 mins, stirring every now and again. You want the onion to soften but not take on any colour.
3. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 mins.
4. Pour in the chicken stock and add the bay leaves. Bring up to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 15 mins with the lid on, until the celeriac cubes are really tender.
5. Pour in the double cream and use a stick blender to whizz until velvety smooth. Season with salt and black pepper and keep warm.
6. Toast the hazelnuts in a frying pan for 2-3 mins until lightly golden and smelling amazing. Tip out of the pan and roughly chop.
7. Melt the remaining butter in the same frying pan with the vegetable oil set over a medium-high heat and add the sage leaves. Fry for 1-2 mins until crisp, then remove from the heat and tip in the toasted hazelnuts.
8. Spoon the soup between bowls and top with some of the crispy sage and buttery hazelnuts. Finish with a crack of black pepper.

Notes:
Marlen H. (2 months ago): Used less butter and sour cream instead of double cream (only two tablespoons) and it was still gorgeous; suggested amounts may be more suitable for 2 servings rather than 4. Colin R. (a year ago): Used crme fraiche instead of double cream; flavours subtle and hazelnuts & sage work perfectly; noted uncertainty about timing when scaling down; highly recommended recipe.

Title: Cauliflower 65
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: N/A

Ingredients:
- 1 Cauliflower
- 10 Curry Leaves
- Vegetable Oil
- 2 Green Chillies
- 5 Curry Leaves
- 2 tbsp Vegetable Oil
- ? tsp Ground Turmeric
- 1 tsp Kashmiri Chilli Powder
- ? tbsp Ginger Paste
- ? tbsp Garlic Paste
- 2 tbsp Yoghurt

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 180¡C. Thinly slice the green chillies for the marinade and transfer to a bowl. Add the remaining marinade ingredients, season with salt and mix well.
2. Trim the cauliflower, then rub the marinade all over. Place onto an oiled baking tray, transfer to the oven and roast for 30-35 mins until tender. Crank the oven temperature up to 200¡C and roast for another 5 mins to get some colour onto the cauliflower.
3. Meanwhile, add a glug of oil to a small frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Once hot, drop the curry leaves in and fry until darkened (theyÕll splutter, so be careful). Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.
4. Once the cauliflower is cooked, plate up and drizzle over the pan juices. Finish with a scattering of crispy curry leaves.

Notes:
Use a whole cauliflower for a show-stopping presentation. Roasting in the oven instead of deep-frying results in a healthier dish. Frying curry leaves adds a crispy texture and flavor; be careful as they will splutter. The final high-temperature roast adds color and slight crispness to the cauliflower.

Becc S.: "Absolutely delish! I added some chopped tenderstem broccoli (steamed for a couple of mins), and subbed the brown onion some leftover red onion that had been pickling for a few days in lemon juice.

Use plenty of flour when rolling thin to avoid sticking. Rolling pastry tightly into logs helps create the spiral layers inside the tart shell. Baking at very high temperature is key to get blistered custard tops and crisp pastry. Serve warm with icing sugar and cinnamon dusted on top; pairs well with strong black coffee.

Title: Creamy Courgette Gratin
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 35 minutes cook time

Ingredients:
- 2? lb Courgettes
- 1 oz Basil
- 5? oz Crme Frache
- 2? fl oz Milk
- 1 tsp Flour
- ? tsp Ground Nutmeg
- 1? oz Parmesan
- 1? oz Cheddar Cheese
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- ? Pinch Chilli Flakes
- 2 x 400g Cans Chopped Tomatoes
- 5 tbsp Olive Oil

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 200¡C. Slice the courgettes into ?cm-thick rounds. Add 3/5 of the olive oil to a large saucepan and place over a medium heat.
2. Add the courgettes, half the basil and a big pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, for 7 to 10 mins until the courgettes have softened and released some of their liquid. Drain well in a colander and give them a gentle press to remove all the excess liquid.
3. Transfer to an ovenproof dish which is small enough to give the courgettes some height.
4. Mix the crme frache, milk, flour and nutmeg together with a pinch of salt. Spread the courgettes into an even layer, then pour the crme frache mixture on top and grate over the cheeses. Bake for 25 mins until golden and bubbling.
5. Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic. Rinse out the saucepan you cooked the courgettes in and place over a medium heat. Add the rest of the olive oil and the chopped garlic.
6. Once the garlic is sizzling, add the remaining basil and chilli (if using). After 30 seconds, pour in the tomatoes. Add 2 tsp salt and bring to a simmer. Cook for 25 mins at a gentle simmer until thickened.
7. Leave the courgettes to rest for 10 mins after cooking and serve a generous slice on top of a few spoons of tomato sauce. Finish with a little extra cheese.

Notes:
from Users Frances M.: "Really tasty - thumbs up from me" Tom S.: "really good! This is more of a side dish tbhÉ made a few changes/swaps for what was in the fridge - feta instead of Parmesan, used mandalin instead of half cm thick cuts, Greek yogurt for the crme fresh - all worked great, look and consistency looked a bit weird of white sauce but didnÕt affect the taste (probably should have drained the courgettes better to prevent) added veggie meatballs to the tomato sauce to make a more substantial dinner." Ann R.: "I love this! So quick to prepare and the bchamel style cheese sauce is so simple! Delicious!" Abigail A.: "A hearty and well rounded dish." Anna K.: "So yummy!"

Title: Courgette Baba Ganoush
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: N/A

Ingredients:
- 4 Courgettes
- 1 oz Fresh Mint
- 3 Garlic Cloves
- 2 tbsp Tahini
- 1? Lemons
- 1 tsp Ground Cumin
- Chilli Flakes (to serve)
- 2 tsp Sumac (to serve)
- Pitta Bread (to serve)
- 3 tbsp Olive Oil

Steps:
1. Set the grill to high or use a very hot BBQ. Grill or BBQ the courgettes whole until blackened on all sides. This will take at least 15-20 mins if using a grill (less on a BBQ).
2. Meanwhile, roughly chop the fresh herbs and set aside. Crush the garlic to a paste and set aside.
3. Carefully remove the courgettes from the heat source and place on a chopping board to cool slightly. Slit the courgettes open lengthways to speed this up. When cool enough to handle, finely chop the courgettes (including the burnt skin) and scoop into a mixing bowl. Drain some of the liquid as it appears in the bowl if you like, or set the chopped courgettes over a sieve in a bowl for 10 mins. Alternatively, leave the liquid in for a looser texture.
4. Add the crushed garlic to the courgette bowl along with the tahini, cumin, lemon juice and zest and olive oil. Mix thoroughly, beating until creamy. Season with salt.
5. Spread the courgette mix out on a serving plate and dress with chilli flakes, sumac, a drizzle of olive oil, and the chopped herbs. Serve with flatbread, pitta or toasted bread on the side.

- 1 tbsp Soy Sauce
- 2 tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil
- 1 tbsp Honey
- ? oz Fresh Coriander
- ? Avocado
- 2 Limes
- 1 Cucumber
- ? Iceberg Lettuce
- 1 x 400g Can Cannellini Bean
- ? oz Fresh Coriander
- 1 Lime
- Toasted Sesame Seed (quantity not specified)
- ? Avocado
- ? oz Fresh Mint
- Fresh Coriander (quantity not specified)
- Tortilla Chips (quantity not specified)
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified)

Steps:
1. *Step 1.** Blend all the dressing ingredients together until bright green and smooth. Taste and add a pinch of salt if needed. If the dressing looks too thick, add more lime juice Ð it should be scoopable but still have a little movement. Set aside in the fridge.
2. *Step 2.** Slice the cucumber into thin diagonal strips, then lay the pieces of cucumber slightly on top of each creating a long line, slice into thin strips, working all the way down the line and add to a large bowl. Cut the lettuce in half and make diagonal slits around the core to remove it. Finely shred one lettuce half and chop the other half into rough cubes. Tip into the cucumber bowl. Roughly slice the coriander and add to the bowl. Drain and rinse the can of beans in a sieve, washing away all the bean juice. Dry the beans very well and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, then add to the bowl of greens. Season the greens with a drizzle of sesame oil, a squeeze of lime and a pinch of salt. Toss well.
3. *Step 3.** Grab a big serving platter and swoosh the creamy dressing all over it. Use tongs to pile the slaw on top in an even layer, trying to leave behind any liquid leaked from the veggies. Top with avocado slices, fresh herbs, toasted sesame seeds, a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a good pinch of flaky sea salt. Pour your favourite tortilla chips into bowls and serve alongside the salad.

Notes:
from Users Rebecca D.: Substituted coriander for basil; loved it. Ellie T.: Sauce was brown instead of green. Bhavna N.: Made beans crispy by frying with paprika; warm salad for winter; loved dressing. Lindsay M.: Loved addition of miso, soy, and sesame in dressing.

Steps:
1. Pile coals over to one side of your BBQ to create a hot, direct cooking side, and a warm, indirect cooking side.
2. Cut the courgettes into chunks, rolling the courgette around as you cut to create irregular shapes. Toss with oil and salt and pile onto the hot side of the grill. Leave to cook, untouched, for 5-6 mins or until one side is really well charred. Toss straight into a bowl.
3. Roughly chop the mint and add to the same bowl, along with the vinegar. Thinly slice the onion and add to the bowl. Toss everything together and top with a bowl to allow the courgettes to steam and soak in that vinegar.
4. Meanwhile, spread the yoghurt over the base of a plate and set a pan over the heat of the BBQ. Add the butter to the pan and let it melt, bubble and start to brown. Add the chilli flakes and a couple of smashed garlic cloves. Allow to infuse into the butter.
5. Pile the warm courgettes and onions onto the plate, then top with the hot chilli butter. Serve with flatbreads on the side and lemon wedges for squeezing.

Notes:
(1) Allegra W., a year ago: Love this one!! The flavour of the sauce is the real winner in this one!! I was worried the cauliflower would fall apart but it held its shape when I cut it thick enough. Some did fall apart prior to cutting correct thickness but as you can see, I just turned them into mini parms. This is the complete detailed recipe as requested.

Title: Spring Green Caesar Salad
Category: Salad
Servings: 4
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: I think

Ingredients:
- 2 Pitta Breads
- 7 oz Tenderstem Broccoli
- 1 tsp Fennel Seed
- 2 Heads Romaine Lettuces
- 1 Cucumber
- 3? oz Edamame
- 3? oz Peas
- 1 Avocado
- ? oz Basil
- ? oz Mint
- ? oz Parsley
- 7 oz Halloumi
- 1 tbsp Honey
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified)
- 1 Egg Yolk
- ? Lemon
- 4? fl oz Olive Oil
- 1 tsp Dijon Mustard
- 1? oz Anchovies
- 1 oz Parsley

Steps:
1. *Step 1.** Heat the oven to 190¡C. Use scissors to snip the pittas into 3cm triangles, then put them on a large baking tray. Add the broccoli and fennel seeds, drizzle with olive oil and season well. Toss and make sure everything is well coated. Slide into the oven for 10-15 mins, or until the broccoli is charred and the pitta chips are crisp.
2. *Step 2.** Meanwhile, make your dressing. Add the yolk to a bowl and lightly whisk. Add a small squeeze of lemon juice, then very slowly add the oil, a trickle at a time, whisking as you go until itÕs emulsified into a thick mayo. Add the Dijon.
3. *Step 3.** Add the parsley, mint, basil and anchovies to a blender with the rest of the lemon juice and a splash of water, then blitz into a paste. Tip the paste into the dressing and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
4. *Step 4.** Cut the base from the lettuce and pull the leaves apart. Put into a large bowl. Slice the cucumber in half lengthways and use a spoon to scrape out the fleshy middle, then slice into half moons and add to the bowl along with the peas and edamame. Halve, de-stone and peel the avocado, slice into cubes and add to the bowl. Add the herb leaves.
5. *Step 5.** Cut the halloumi into small chunks. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the halloumi and cook for 5 mins, turning the chunks as they colour. Remove from the heat and add the honey.
6. *Step 6.** Add the pitta chips and roasted broccoli to the large salad bowl, drizzle with the dressing and toss well. Add the honey halloumi and toss briefly, then serve.

Title: Title
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 40 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 1 Celeriac
- 3? fl oz Double Cream
- 1 Garlic Clove
- ? oz Fresh Thyme
- 6 Black Peppercorns
- 1? oz Salted Butter
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified)

Steps:
1. Top and tail the celeriac, then use a large knife to trim off all of the skin, without taking off too much flesh. Dice into 2cm cubes and tip into a saucepan.
2. Pour in enough cold water to completely submerge the celeriac and season generously with salt.
3. Set over a high heat and bring to the boil. Once simmering, turn the heat down to medium-high and cook for 15 mins, until the celeriac is very soft.
4. Meanwhile, pour the double cream into a small saucepan. Put the garlic clove, still in its skin, onto the chopping board and use the flat side of a large knife to bash it against the chopping board. Add this to the cream along with the thyme sprigs and black peppercorns.
5. Set the small saucepan over a medium heat and bring up to a simmer. Once simmering, remove from the heat and leave to infuse.
6. Drain the celeriac really well through a fine sieve, then tip into a bowl or back into the dry pan.
7. Use a potato masher to crush and mash until roughly smooth, or you can use a stick blender to whizz until smooth - or if you want it really smooth, tip into a blender and whizz to a super smooth pure.
8. Put the fine sieve over the bowl and pour in the double cream, catching all the infusion bits.
9. Add cubes of the butter and keep mashing and mixing until combined and smooth.
10. Season really well with salt and pepper and serve.

Notes:
Celeriac offers a richer, deeper flavor with a bit of nuttiness compared to regular mashed potatoes. The garlic should be left in its skin when bashing and simmering with cream for infusion. You can adjust texture by mashing roughly or making it very smooth with a blender. If you need any further formatting or details, let me know!

Cooked: Yes
Time: 25 mins cook

Ingredients:
- :
- 1 Celeriac
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- 1? oz Butter (approx. 50g)
- 1 oz Fresh Flat Leaf Parsley (approx. 28g)
- 2 tbsp Capers
- 2 tsp Dijon Mustard
- 1 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil (quantity as needed)
- Salt (to season)
- Cracked Black Pepper (to season)

Steps:
1. :
2. Heat the oven to 180¡C.
3. Top and tail the celeriac, then use a large knife to trim off all of the skin, without taking off too much flesh. Cut two 2cm-thick steaks from the middle of the celeriac. Save the rest for soup or mash (can tag both). Use the flat side of the knife to bash the garlic cloves on the chopping board to flatten them.
4. Pour a drizzle of olive oil over the celeriac steaks and season really well with salt and pepper.
5. Heat an ovenproof frying pan, big enough to fit both steaks, set over a medium-high heat.
6. Lay the celeriac steaks into the pan and cook for 3 mins on one side, until caramelised. Flip and cook for 2 mins, then turn the heat down to medium, add the butter and smashed garlic cloves and baste the celeriac steak for another minute, then flip and baste the other side for a further minute. Put the pan into the oven and roast for 15 mins, until the celeriac steaks are charred and soft.
7. Finely chop the parsley and scrape into a bowl. Roughly chop the capers and add to the bowl along with the mustard, red wine vinegar and a splash of olive oil. Season with salt and cracked black pepper.
8. Remove the celeriac steaks from the oven and divide between plates, spooning on some of the butter. Serve with a good drizzle of salsa verde.

Notes:
: These celeriac steaks are butter-basted and finished in the oven so theyÕre crisp and caramelised on the outside and meltingly soft within. Finished with a bright, vibrant and punchy salsa verde. You wonÕt believe how delicious this roasted celeriac recipe is. FAQ Highlight: Q: Could this work air fryer style?! A: We'd recommend you still cook and baste in the pan, then transfer to the airfryer to finish cooking with all the butter etc. For ease you can try and do it all in airfryer but it wonÕt get that even golden/deep colour! Serves: 2 Title: Leek and Celeriac Gratin Cooking time: 1 hr cook Ingredients: 1 Celeriac 2 Leeks 2 Cloves Garlic ? oz Thyme ? oz Butter 14 fl oz Double Cream 14 fl oz Milk 1 Pinch Nutmeg 2 oz Gruyre 1 oz Panko Breadcrumbs Recipe Steps: 1. Preheat the oven to 170¡C. 2. Start by prepping your vegetables. Peel your celeriac, cut it in half, and chop it into thin slices. Halve your leeks, discarding the woody ends, and slice them into thin half-moons. Grate your garlic and pick your thyme leaves off their tough stalks. 3. Melt your butter in a large saucepan. Add your leeks and cook over a low-medium heat for 15 minutes until they are totally soft and sweet. Pop your garlic and thyme into the pan and cook out for 1 minute. 4. Pour your cream and milk into the pan and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add your celeriac and simmer for 15 minutes until your cream has thickened and your celeriac is just tender. Add your nutmeg. 5. Whilst your mixture simmers, grate your Gruyre. Combine with your panko breadcrumbs in a bowl and set aside. 6. Pour your celeriac and leek mixture into a baking dish and top with your cheese and breadcrumbs. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. 7. Remove your foil, then bake for another 20 minutes until golden and bubbly. 8. Serve up with some crusty bread, a roast chicken, or just on its own. Notes: Oven temperature for baking is 170¡C. The crisp breadcrumbs and Gruyre are crucial for the dish. The recipe is dauphinoise-inspired. Chef Sophie Wyburd specializes in simple, hearty comfort food. The dish pairs well with crusty bread or roast chicken but can be served alone. If you want, I can also provide nutrition info or any other details from the page.

Title: Creamy Courgette Gratin
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 35 mins cook

Ingredients:
- 2? lb (approx 1.02 kg) Courgettes
- 1 oz (28 g) Basil
- 5? oz (150 g) Crme Frache
- 2? fl oz (80 ml) Milk
- 1 tsp Flour
- ? tsp Ground Nutmeg
- 1? oz (50 g) Parmesan
- 1? oz (50 g) Cheddar Cheese
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- ? Pinch Chilli Flakes
- 2 x 400 g Cans Chopped Tomatoes
- 5 tbsp Olive Oil

Steps:
1. ### Step 1 Heat the oven to 200¡C. Slice the courgettes into ?cm-thick rounds. Add 3/5 of the olive oil to a large saucepan and place over a medium heat. ### Step 2 Add the courgettes, half the basil and a big pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, for 7 to 10 mins until the courgettes have softened and released some of their liquid. Drain well in a colander and give them a gentle press to remove all the excess liquid. ### Step 3 Transfer to an ovenproof dish which is small enough to give the courgettes some height. ### Step 4 Mix the crme frache, milk, flour and nutmeg together with a pinch of salt. Spread the courgettes into an even layer, then pour the crme frache mixture on top and grate over the cheeses. Bake for 25 mins until golden and bubbling. ### Step 5 Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic. Rinse out the saucepan you cooked the courgettes in and place over a medium heat. Add the rest of the olive oil and the chopped garlic. ### Step 6 Once the garlic is sizzling, add the remaining basil and chilli (if using). After 30 seconds, pour in the tomatoes. Add 2 tsp salt and bring to a simmer. Cook for 25 mins at a gentle simmer until thickened. ### Step 7 Leave the courgettes to rest for 10 mins after cooking and serve a generous slice on top of a few spoons of tomato sauce. Finish with a little extra cheese.

Notes:
(from users) Frances M.: Really tasty - thumbs up from me. Tom S.: This is more of a side dish. Made changes: feta instead of Parmesan, mandalin instead of half cm thick cuts, Greek yogurt for crme frache - all worked great. Suggested draining courgettes better to prevent odd consistency of white sauce. Added veggie meatballs to tomato sauce for more substantial dinner. Ann R.: Quick to prepare and bchamel style cheese sauce is simple and delicious. Abigail A.: A hearty and well rounded dish. Anna K.: So yummy! Rachel L.: Delicious side dish.

Title: Fish & Celeriac Stew
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: N/A

Ingredients:
- 14 oz Frozen Cod
- 1 Celeriac
- 1 Red Onion
- 1 tsp Fennel Seed
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 4 Anchovies
- 6? fl oz White Wine
- 28? oz Passata
- 8? oz Drained Cooked Chickpeas
- 1 Bunch Parsley
- Salt (quantity not specified)
- Olive Oil (quantity not specified)

Steps:
1. Take your cod out of the freezer and de-frost it.
2. Preheat your oven to 180¡C / 356¡F.
3. Finely slice your onions and whack them on a baking tray with a pinch of salt, pepper, and a drizzle of oil. Place the tray in the oven and roast for 20 minutes.
4. Dice your celeriac, then heat a glug of oil in a pan and fry it over a low heat.
5. Slice your garlic and anchovies, and add them to the celeriac along with your fennel seeds and chilli flakes. Fry until golden brown.
6. Pour in your glass of wine and passata, stir together then bubble down for 5 minutes.
7. Toss through your chickpeas then keep bubbling for 10 further minutes until the sauce is nice and thick.
8. Chop the cod into chunks and stir it into the dish. Leave to simmer for 5 minutes for the cod to cook through.
9. Once the fish is nice and flakey, finely chop up your parsley and scatter into the dish with your roasted onions (saving some of each for garnish). Season and give it a good stir.
10. Serve up into 4 bowls and garnish with parsley, some roasted onion and a drizzle of oil. Enjoy!

Notes:
Charring the celeriac makes it all nutty and caramelised. With the flaky cod, in the rich tomatoey stew, it's a dream. ### User Notes: Polly K. (4 months ago): Flavours are really good! Would recommend cutting the celeriac quite small and cooking the sauce for longer. I also added some sugar. Robyn M. (1 year ago): It's delicious but with peeling and chopping the celeriac and onion and getting everything browned, defrosted, reduced etc., it took over 2 hours rather than 30 minutes! I also added a sugar cube because I thought the sauce needed it.

Title: Dark Chocolate & Pistachio Meringues
Category: General
Servings: N/A
Rating: N/A
Cooked: Yes
Time: 2 hr cook

Ingredients:
- 5 Egg Whites
- ? Lemon
- 8 oz Golden Caster Sugar
- 1 oz Cocoa Powder
- 5? oz 70% Dark Chocolate
- 2? oz Pistachios

Steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 120¡C fan. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Make sure your egg whites are at room temperature.
2. In a bowl, use an electric whisk to whip the egg whites with the juice of the lemon and a pinch of salt for about 2 mins until soft peaks form. Slowly beat in the sugar, 2 tbsp at a time, and continue until thick and glossy and stiff peaks are forming (when you hold the whisk up, the mixture should stand in a firm peak). Sieve the cocoa powder then fold it into the meringue mix, using a metal spoon or spatula.
3. Using a metal dessert spoon (or a piping bag with the 1M nozzle / 1.5cm open star nozzle attached), transfer neat tablespoon-sized dollops of meringue onto your baking tray.
4. Bake for 1 hour, or until set, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside to dry for another hour with the oven door closed.
5. Meanwhile, roughly chop the pistachios, or grind them with a pestle and mortar until fine but not powdery.
6. When the meringues are cool, break the chocolate into pieces. Add to a heat proof mixing bowl and set over a pot of gently boiling water (a bain marie). Stir until melted.
7. Very carefully, dip the base of each meringue first in the chocolate, then in the crushed pistachio. Alternatively, use a teaspoon to zig-zag chocolate across the top of each meringue and dust with pistachio.

Notes:
Rich cocoa meringues dipped in dark chocolate and chopped pistachios. An incredible base for a dessert. Make sure egg whites are at room temperature before whipping. Use a gentle folding motion to incorporate cocoa powder. Dry meringues in oven after baking by leaving them inside with oven off and door closed. Use a bain marie to melt chocolate gently. Pistachios can be roughly chopped or ground but not powdered.

Notes:
Jo C.: "With this with years courgette glut this recipe has been on regularly rotation. Discovered goats cheese pearls which I have served on this both frozen & fresh although they look like mini marshmallows they are a great fun addition." Becky M.: "Forgot to put the goats cheese in the freezer lol but was still gorgeous. I personally wish IÕd cut the courgette into smaller chunks or even long slices as I feel they taste better that way. Just a tip to make sure the courgette has cooled before serving - my meal went quite watery bc I couldnÕt wait lol. Would make again for sure, thanks Jodie!" Amy H.: "Love this recipe, to the point I tend to leave a block of goats cheese in the freezer now! If I want to bulk it out a bit, I either chuck it all on top of some extra salad leaves or occasionally add a chicken breast. I also tend to use plain honey and add chilli flakes so I can get the heat levels to my preference." Julie B.: "We served this as a starter and it was just delicious."

Ingredients:
- | Quantity (Metric) | Quantity (Imperial) | Ingredient               |
- |

Steps:
1. Chop two onions and all of the garlic. Peel and cut the potato into 2cm cubes. Roughly chop the cauliflower into small pieces, including the stem.
2. Add the 3-4 tbsp oil to a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent and softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic, stir, and cook for another minute or so, until fragrant but not browned.
3. Make the stock by dissolving the stock cubes in the boiling water.
4. Add the curry powder, ground turmeric, garam masala, and coriander. Stir, allowing the spices to toast for about 30 seconds.
5. Add in sweet potato, cauliflower, vegetable stock, and silken tofu. Cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 25-35 mins.
6. Using an immersion blender, or a standing blender, blend the soup until it is smooth and creamy. Add a little more water if you want a thinner texture.
7. To make the tarka topping, start by finely slicing the remaining onion. Melt 3 tbsp coconut oil in a frying pan on medium low. Add the mustard seeds and sizzle for a minute or two, before adding the red onion and a pinch of salt. Fry the onion for 10-15 minutes on a medium-low heat until softened and slightly sticky, stirring often.
8. Then, add the curry leaves, turmeric and chilli flakes, along with a pinch of salt. Sizzle over a low-medium heat for a final 2-3 minutes. Drizzle on top of the soup to serve.

Notes:
This soup packs in some secret protein by swapping out coconut milk for silken tofu. It gives it a delicious creamy texture without an overpowering taste. The spicy, crispy onion topping really makes it. Some users noted the protein content is around 7g per portion and questioned the "high-protein" label. There was an issue with soup being watery; water amount adjusted from 1.7L to 1L after feedback. Adding a little cayenne or sausage on the side was suggested by users for extra flavor. The recipe serves 4.

- ? oz Mint
- 1 Courgette
- 4? oz Self Raising Flour
- 7 oz Feta
- 5? fl oz Vegetable Oil
- 10? oz Greek Yoghurt
- ? Lemon
- 1 Clove Garlic
- 1 Egg

Steps:
1. Halve the cucumber lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Grate the cucumber straight into a sieve and mix with a large pinch of salt. Allow to drain while you make the fritters.
2. Finely chop the tomato, onion and herbs. Reserve half of the mint and add everything else to a large bowl along with the egg. Grate in the courgette and add 100g of flour, the feta and a large pinch of salt, mix well.
3. Depending on the moisture in the tomatoes you might need to add the remaining flour to ensure the mix binds together. The batter should be thick and paste-like, add more flour, if needed, to get it to the right consistency.
4. Heat ? an inch of vegetable oil in a nonstick frying pan. When the oil is hot, add the mix in heaped tablespoons, keeping each heaped heap a couple of inches apart.
5. Fry for about 3 mins on each side until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon onto kitchen paper.
6. Squeeze as much remaining liquid as possible from the cucumber and then combine in a bowl with the yoghurt, juice of half a lemon, the remaining mint and a pinch of salt.
7. Grate in the garlic, mix well and spread over a small plate. Stack a few fritters next to the yoghurt and serve.

Notes:
(User Feedback) Theo D.: Used slightly less tomato for less watery mixture (added extra flour). Took around 45 minutes instead of 25. Found fritters a little oily but balanced with pickled salad. Rachel D.: Initially mixture was too wet so added more flour and an extra egg. Enjoyed them despite not liking vegetables much. Plans to try pepper and spinach next time. Jess W.: Recommended as a great way to use courgettes and tomatoes from the garden. Georgia R.: Mixture was very wet, added more flour after first attempt. Kept half mix overnight, added more flour and an extra egg for better result. Mob (Admin): Updated method for clarity based on feedback.
