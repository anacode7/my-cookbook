Title: Cheeseboard Cheesecake
Category: Dessert
Servings: Not specified
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 1 hr

Ingredients:
- 0.5 oz Chive
- 1.5 oz Parmesan
- 26.5 oz Cream Cheese
- 4 Eggs
- 10.5 fl oz Double Cream
- 1 tsp Fine Salt
- 3 oz Gorgonzola
- 1.5 oz Cornflour
- Cream Crackers (to serve)
- Black Pepper (to serve)

Steps:
1. Heat the oven to 250°C. Line a 20cm cake tin with two sheets of crumpled baking paper, making sure there's an overhang of 3cm all the way round.
2. Finely chop the chives and finely grate the Parmesan, then set aside. Put the cream cheese into a large bowl and beat until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating in each one entirely. Add the cream, parmesan, chives, fine salt and pepper, then mix to combine. Crumble in the gorgonzola and sieve in the cornflour. Fold in and mix well to combine.
3. Pour the mixture into the lined cake tin and transfer to the oven. Bake for 17-20 mins until dark on the top but very, very wobbly in the middle. It will sink and firm up as it cools. Cover and leave overnight before slicing and serving with crackers, warm bread and chutney.

Notes:
Oven temperature is for a fan-assisted oven. Gorgonzola can be replaced with harder, less fatty cheeses to avoid splitting during cooking (Camembert might be too gooey). The cheesecake tastes amazing and is very moorish. Let it cool overnight covered before serving.

Title: Halloumi & Burnt Broccoli Salad

Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 35 mins

Ingredients:
- 7 oz Bulgur Wheat

- 1 Lemon
- 1 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar
- 1 tbsp Dried Oregano
- 1 oz Almonds

- Salt
- Black Pepper

Steps:
1. Pile coals over to one side of your BBQ to create a hot, direct cooking side, and a warm, indirect cooking side.
2. Pop your bulgur wheat into a bowl and rinse well with cold water. Bring a pot of salted water to the boil and pour in the rinsed bulgur. Cook for 10 mins, then drain. Pop back into the pan and cover with a lid, then allow to steam for 10 mins.
3. Cut the halloumi into chunky cubes and split the broccoli into quarters through the stem. Oil and salt the broccoli and get it straight onto the hot side of your grill. Cook, undisturbed, for 4-5 mins or until the cut-side of the broccoli is super charred. Flip over and give the broccoli another 4-5 mins.
4. While the broccoli grills, finely chop the chilli, cucumber, red onion and parsley. Tip into a bowl with the warm bulgur, then add the fresh peas, the juice of the lemon and the vinegar. Add the oregano and parsley.
5. Once grilled, pull the broccoli off the grill and roughly chop. Toss through the bulgur. Add plenty of olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Toss everything together and set aside.
6. Roll the diced halloumi in oil, then add to the hot side of the BBQ. Grill the halloumi for 3-4 mins, turning now and then, until golden brown and crisp.
7. Pile the salad onto a platter and top with the halloumi. Roughly chop the almonds and scatter over the top. Serve!

Notes:
This has crept in as a new weekly regular. Very refreshing in the summer. Delicious and very easy to make. Can substitute goat cheese for halloumi. Recipe by Ben Lippett.

Title: Caramelised Onion & Anchovy Tortilla
Category: Main
Servings: 4
Rating: Not specified
Cooked: Not specified
Time: 35 mins

Ingredients:
- 8 Eggs
- 3 Onions
- 4 Potatoes
- 3 Roasted Red Peppers
- 1.5 oz Anchovies
- 1 tbsp Smoked Paprika
- 4 tbsp Aioli
- 2 Spring Onions
- Olive Oil (approx 100ml plus plenty for cooking)

Steps:
1. Preheat the grill to medium-high (190°C).
2. Crack your eggs into a large bowl, season with salt and whisk with a fork. Set aside.
3. Thinly slice your onions and get them into a pan with plenty of olive oil. Cook down with a pinch of salt for 9-10 mins until caramelised.
4. Meanwhile, peel and slice your potatoes as thin as you can. Chuck them into the pan with the onions and add a shed load of olive oil, approx 100ml (trust me).
5. Cover and cook, stirring regularly for 7-8 mins until the potatoes are just tender. Now drain off the excess oil (save this for later!) and mix the onions and potatoes into the eggs.
6. Slice up the peppers and roughly chop the anchovies and get them into the bowl with the eggs. Mix everything together and season with salt, pepper and a generous pinch of sweet smoked paprika.
7. Now grab a 24cm non-stick frying pan (trust me, you want it non-stick). Add a splash of the leftover olive oil and preheat over medium-low.
8. Dump the egg mixture into the pan (you should hear a gentle sizzle) and shake to distribute the potatoes, peppers and anchovies throughout the pan.
9. Now turn down the heat and cook for 10-12 mins until the sides begin to set. Pop it under the grill for 4-5 minutes.
10. Now, grab a large plate or lid and flip the tortilla out. Slide it back into the pan and cook for another 3-4 mins. Turn the tortilla out onto a chopping board and cut into wedges.
11. Now top with aioli, extra paprika and sliced spring onions. Serve with a green salad if you fancy it.

Notes:
If you can manage it, save some tortilla for the next day and stuff the leftovers into a sandwich with heaps of aioli. You won't regret it. Recipe by Ben Lippett.
